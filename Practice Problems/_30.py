# The current population of a town is 10000. The population of the town 
# is increasing at the rate of 10% per year. You have to write a program 
# to find out the population at the end of each of the last 10 years. 
# For eg current population is 10000 so the output should be like this:
# 10th year - 10000
# 9th year - 9000
# 8th year - 8100 and so on
